# Open Bandit Dataset

This directory contains the small size (10,000 records for each pair of campaign and behavior policy) version of our data that can be used for running [examples](https://github.com/st-tech/zr-obp/tree/master/examples).
The full size version of our data is available at [https://research.zozo.com/data.html](https://research.zozo.com/data.html).


This dataset is released along with the paper:

## Data description
Open Bandit Dataset is constructed in an A/B test of two multi-armed bandit policies in a large-scale fashion e-commerce platform, [ZOZOTOWN](https://zozo.jp/).
It currently consists of a total of 26M rows, each one representing a user impression with some feature values, selected items as actions, true propensity scores, and click indicators as an outcome.
This is especially suitable for evaluating *off-policy evaluation* (OPE), which attempts to predict the counterfactual performance of hypothetical algorithms using data generated by a different algorithm in use.


## Fields
Here is a detailed description of the fields (they are comma-separated in the CSV files):

**{behavior_policy}/{campaign}.csv** (behavior_policy in (bts, random), campaign in (all, men, women))
- timestamp: timestamps of impressions.
- item_id: index of items as arms (index ranges from 0-80 in "All" campaign, 0-33 for "Men" campaign, and 0-46 "Women" campaign).
- position: the position of an item being recommended (1, 2, or 3 correspond to left, center, and right position of the ZOZOTOWN recommendation interface, respectively).
- click: target variable that indicates if an item was clicked (1) or not (0).
- propensity_score: the probability of an item being recommended at each position.
- user feature 0-4: user-related feature values.
- user-item affinity 0-: user-item affinity scores induced by the number of past clicks observed between each user-item pair.

**item_context.csv**
- item_id: index of items as arms (index ranges from 0-80 in "All" campaign, 0-33 for "Men" campaign, and 0-46 "Women" campaign).
- item feature 0-3: item related feature values
